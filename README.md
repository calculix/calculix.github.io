# Welcome to CalculiX!

Dear users,

Thank you for entering the organization! It would be nice if this place will become a central platform for CalculiX development. Now the users community is a little bit scattered especially after Yahoo groups closure. I hope GitHub will unite all of us and make CalculiX software even better and more accessible.

Please, invite your colleagues, transfer here your projects related to CalculiX, communicate and collaborate. Let's make CalculiX great again! :)
